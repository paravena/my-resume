        I have extensive experience as a software developer for over 15 years.
        My expertise lies in various technologies and programming languages,
        particularly JavaScript and Java. One of my key areas of focus in my
        daily work is unit testing and functional testing, as they aid me in
        understanding user requirements before beginning any coding tasks. In
        essence, I am a software developer who prioritizes understanding user
        needs and then strives to implement the best solutions to meet those
        expectations.
